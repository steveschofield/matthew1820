            <li><b>Q: Why is the project named Matthew 18:20?</b> </li>
            <li>A: We are following a prompt from God to provide a easy, safe mechanism to submit prayer following Matthew 18:20 (where two or meet my presence is there with you). Since most everyone has a mobile device, this is a quick way to reach a world-wide audience of intercessors / prayer warriors.</li>
            <li><b>Q: Why does no one read the raw prayers?</b></li>
            <li>A: As part of this project, we are following God's lead and scripture in Matthew 6:6.  The prayer is meant for you and God only.</li>
            <li><b>Q: Are my prayers read by anyone else after submitting?</b></li>
            <li>A: No, the actual text is never read by anyone.  The program will process your prayer, recording a) when b) how many words in prayers c) And location (if allowed).  Location is only displayed on map and accuracy is within 1 mile. If someone doesn't allow location, we record the Garden of Gethsemane in Israel. </li>
            <li><b>Q: How often is the Map refreshed on homepage?</b></li>
            <li>A: The Map is usually refreshed every 24 hours.  This can depend on caching on the internet.</li>
            <li><b>Q: If I sign-up as a prayer warrior / intercessor, how often will I get a email?</b></li>
            <li>A: You will be notified daily with a previous summary of a) number of prayers, b) number of words</li>
            <li><b>Q: Can I un-subscribe from receiving emails?</b></li>
            <li>A: Yes, you can un-subscribe anytime.  Just click on the link and Amazon will un-subscribe immediately</li>
            <li><b>Q: Are prayers stored for historical purposes?</b></li>
            <li>A: Raw prayer files are stored encrypted and not accessible from the internet.  After processing the file to record a) when it was submitted b) how many words c) location.  The file is deleted.</li>
            <li><b>Q: Where can I view source code for this website?</b> </li>
            <li>A:<a href="https://github.com/steveschofield/matthew1820" target="_blank"> Github source code repository</a></li>
            <li><b>Q: When will a mobile application for Android and iOS be available??</b> </li>
            <li>A mobile application is under current development for both platforms. We are targetting Q2 of 2020 for a beta release.</li>
            <li><b>Q: Is there a diagram of technical services used?</b> </li>
            <li>A: <a href="https://github.com/steveschofield/matthew1820/wiki/Infrastructure-and-deliverables" target="_blank">Diagram on Github</a></li>
            <li><b>Q: I received two emails when signing up?</b> </li>
            <li>A: This is known issue and will be addressed in future updates.  We are using Amazon SNS service to send notifications.</li>
            <li><b>Q: I received a prompte to share my location similar to this picture <br /><img src="images/locationprompt.png" width="300px" height="200px"></b> </li>
            <li>A: The prompt uses Geolocation API built into the browser.  We capture the longitude and latitude. This is graphed on the homepage map.  We felt prompted by the Lord to offer where prayers are coming from and prayer warriors are located.  No names are published.</li>
